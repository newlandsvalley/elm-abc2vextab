==============

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is intended to be a utility which translates an __AbcTune__ which is defined in [Abc.ParseTree](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/elm-abc-parser/blob/master/src/Abc/ParseTree.elm) into [VexTab](http://www.vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html) and hence will eventually allow scores to be produced from ABC tunes.
